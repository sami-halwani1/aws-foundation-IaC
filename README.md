# AWS CloudFormation Use Cases
This repository contains a series of short-form, production-relevant Infrastructure as Code (IaC) examples using AWS CloudFormation. Each example is built to demonstrate a specific capability or pattern within AWS — from serverless compute and event-driven automation to database lifecycle management and CI/CD integrations.

The goal of this repo is to showcase my practical experience designing, deploying, and automating cloud infrastructure using declarative templates, with an emphasis on clarity, modularity, and security.

## 📌 Highlights include:
Scheduled Lambda execution using EventBridge

- Static Website Using AWS S3
- API Gateway + Lambda REST API deployment
- API Gateway + Lambda + DynamoDB POST
- EC2 w/ HTTP and SSH Access + nginx  
- and More

Each folder includes a template and a brief explanation of the use case, architecture, and deployment steps.
